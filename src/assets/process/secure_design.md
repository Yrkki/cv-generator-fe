# Secure Development Knowledge

## Implement Secure Design

The project implements secure design principles.

The project results have fail-safe defaults. Access decisions are denied by default, and projects' installation is secure by default. They also have complete mediation (every access that might be limited is checked for authority and be non-bypassable). In cases where principles will conflict, a choice is made (e.g., many mechanisms can make things more complex, contravening "economy of mechanism" / keep it simple).
