# Quick Start Guide

This project here only represents the solution front end (main part). If you intend to adjust it as to using your own data, you should plan for implementing a backend first, according to the data formats expected, be it either a file system based folder, a compliant project server, or a public cloud data lake (e.g. object storage) and appropriate CDN.

If interested in the UI experience only, feel free to fork and experiment.
