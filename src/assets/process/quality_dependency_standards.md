# Externally-Maintained Components

The dependencies are listed in the [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/ "NPM") *Node.js®* package manager *package.json* file.

## Dependency Monitoring

To detect known vulnerabilities, and fix exploitable vulnerabilities or verify them as unexploitable the dependencies are monitored via the [David](https://david-dm.org/ "David") *Node.js®* dependency management tool:

[![npm dependencies](https://status.david-dm.org/gh/Yrkki/cv-generator-fe.svg)](https://david-dm.org/Yrkki/cv-generator-fe "npm dependencies")
[![npm devDependencies](https://status.david-dm.org/gh/Yrkki/cv-generator-fe.svg?type=dev)](https://david-dm.org/Yrkki/cv-generator-fe?type=dev "npm devDependencies")

## Updateable Reused Components

The project makes it easy to identify and update reused externally-maintained components via the [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/ "NPM") *Node.js®* package manager.

Then, if a vulnerability is found in a reused component, it is easy to update that component.

## Interfaces Current

The project avoids using deprecated or obsolete functions and APIs where alternatives are available in the technology stack, and to a supermajority of the users the project supports (so that users have ready access to the alternative).
