# Secure Release

## Signed Releases

Releases currently not intended for widespread use.

Should the need arise at a later stage, the project will cryptographically sign releases of the project results intended for widespread use, and there will be a documented process explaining to users how they can obtain the public signing keys and verify the signatures. The private key for these signatures will be on sites used to directly distribute the software to the public.

## Version Tags Signed

Releases currently not intended for widespread use.

Should the need arise at a later stage, in the version control system, each important version tag (a tag that is part of a major release, minor release, or fixes publicly noted vulnerabilities) will be cryptographically signed and verifiable as described in signed releases.
