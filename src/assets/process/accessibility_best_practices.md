# Accessibility

Accessibility is currently being tested via the [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse "Google Lighthouse") tool.

More efforts are constantly being applied as to meeting the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/ "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0)") standards within the scope of the next version.
