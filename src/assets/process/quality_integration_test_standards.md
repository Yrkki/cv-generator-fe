# Automated Test Suite

Automated integration tests performed with:

* [Protractor](https://www.protractortest.org/ "Protractor") end-to-end test framework.

Applied on each check-in to the shared repository.

This test suite produces a report on test success or failure.

## Regression Tests Added 50

The continuous integration test process is supercharged and tuned for regression for at least 50% of the bugs fixed within the last six months.

## Test Statement Coverage 80

Code coverage performed with:

* [Istanbul](https://istanbul.js.org/ "Istanbul") code coverage tool.

The continuous integration test process statement coverage is supercharged and tuned for **97.5%**.

Also external code coverage trackers connected:

* [Codecov](https://codecov.io/ "Codecov") code coverage tracker.
* [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io "Coveralls") code coverage tracker.

[![Codecov code coverage status](https://codecov.io/gh/Yrkki/cv-generator-fe/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/Yrkki/cv-generator-fe "Codecov code coverage status")
[![Coveralls code coverage status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/Yrkki/cv-generator-fe/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/Yrkki/cv-generator-fe?branch=master "Coveralls code coverage status")

Meeting this criterion is not a guarantee that the test suite is thorough, instead, failing to meet this criterion is a strong indicator of a poor test suite.
